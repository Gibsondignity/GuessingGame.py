# GuessingGame.py
My first python project.
This project is a guessing game that asks the user to think of 20 numbers.
Ranging from 1 to 20.
If the user's quess is less than the random number, it will prompt the user that their quess is low.
Otherwise, if thier quess is high, it will still prompt the user that thier quess is high.
Which will help the user to choose within a specific range of numbers.
